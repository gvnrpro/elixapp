## Executive Summary

As an expert developer with extensive experience in asset management solutions, I've conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Elix platform. While the application demonstrates innovative spatial UI design and good architectural foundations, there are critical gaps in core asset management functionality that must be addressed for enterprise readiness.

**Overall Assessment: 6.5/10**
- Visual Design & UX: 9/10 (Exceptional spatial computing interface)
- Core Asset Management: 4/10 (Missing essential enterprise features)
- Data Architecture: 5/10 (Oversimplified for enterprise needs)
- Technical Implementation: 7/10 (Good patterns but needs refinement)

- Absent depreciation tracking and financial management
- No retirement/disposal workflows
- Missing compliance and regulatory tracking

**Enterprise Impact:**
- Cannot manage complex equipment hierarchies (engines within vehicles within fleets)
- No financial visibility into asset ROI and depreciation
- Compliance violations due to missing audit trails
- Inability to plan asset replacements strategically

**Required Solutions:**
```typescript
interface EnterpriseAsset {
  // Enhanced hierarchy support
  parentAssetId?: string;
  childAssetIds: string[];
  assetHierarchyPath: string; // e.g., "fleet/vehicle/engine"
  
  // Financial management
  purchasePrice: number;
  currentValue: number;
  depreciationSchedule: DepreciationSchedule;
  insuranceInfo: InsuranceDetails;
  
  // Compliance & regulatory
  certifications: Certification[];
  regulatoryStatus: RegulatoryStatus;
  auditTrail: AuditEvent[];
  
  // Lifecycle status
  lifecycleStage: 'planning' | 'acquisition' | 'operational' | 'maintenance' | 'disposal';
